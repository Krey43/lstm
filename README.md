# LSTM experiments

This repository caontains files for my Neural Networks final project. My work is focused on exploring possibilities and limitations of Long Short Term Memory networks. Check the wiki for explanation.

The code is based on the iplementation of LSTM provided by Jan Chorowski for Neural Networks course on University of Wroclaw.
